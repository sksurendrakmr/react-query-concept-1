React Query
What?
A library for fetching data in a react application.

Why we need a library for data feteching?
1) Since React is a UI library, there is no specific pattern for data fetching.
2) Typically, we make use of useEffect hook for data fetching and useState hook
   to maintain component state like loading, error or resulting data.
3) If the data is needed throughout the app, we tend to use state management libraries.
4) Most of the state management libraries are good for working with client state.
    Ex.'theme' for the application / whether a modal is open.
5) State management libraries are not great for working with asynchronous or server state.
   This is because server state is very different to client state.

Client vs server state

Client state
Persisted in our app memory and accessing or updating it is synchronous.

Server state
Persisted remotely and requires asynchronous APIs for fetching or updating.

Server state has shared ownership i.e data can be updated by someone else without our
knowledge which can quickly lead to UI data that may not be in sync with the remote
data.

More challenging when we have to deal with caching, deduping multiple requests for the same data,
updating stale data in the backgorund. performance optimizations etc.

This challennged can be solved with react query library.

Features we will covered:-
Basic queries âœ”
Poll data
RQ dev tools
create reusable query hooks
query by ID
parallel queries
Dynamic queries
Dependent queries
Infinite and paginated queries

We also need to keep in mind that the server state is not just fetching,
it also needs updating.

For that :-
Update data using mutations
Invalidate queries when mutation is successful
OPtimistic update
Axios Interceptor with react query

 steps
 1) install the package
 2) we need to add react query to our application
      At the top of our component tree, we need to add reactQueryProvider and provide the
      client to the provider. 
      By doing so,we will have access to every hook and method that react query provides.
